# Process Scheduling (oss) Application

Process Scheduling (oss) application by Brett Huffman for CMP SCI 4760 - Project 4 - V1.0

In this project, I simultate the process scheduling aspects of an OS.  Time-based scheduling is implemented in a main executable application that manages the execution of concurrent user processes.  Message Queues handle synchronization between the main application and it's concurrent user processes.

A log was kept of each day's activity.  It is found at the end of this README file.

A Git repository was maintained with a public remote found here: https://github.com/dicer2000/CS4760_ProcessScheduling.git

## Assumptions

```
